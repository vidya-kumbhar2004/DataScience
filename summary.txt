During Week 1, I learned the basics of Python programming. 
I practiced how to use variables, different data types, input and output statements, operators, and mathematical expressions. 
I also understood how conditional statements like if and else work, and how to use loops such as for loops to repeat tasks.

I wrote several small programs to strengthen these concepts, including a calculator, a temperature converter, 
and scripts that check whether a number is even or odd and print a range of numbers. 
These exercises helped me understand how logic flows in a program.

For the Week 1 mini project, I created a temperature analysis script. 
The program takes multiple temperature readings from the user, stores them, then calculates the average, highest, and lowest values. 
This task helped me apply loops, lists, input handling, and basic built-in functions like sum(), max(), and min().

Overall, Week 1 helped me understand the core foundations of Python and gave me confidence 
to move further into data structures and data manipulation.
